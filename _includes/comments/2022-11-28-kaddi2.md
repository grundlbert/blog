joooo, jungle princess, it's me again!
It is so lovely to read your blog, I feel like I am living your stories a bit! It is so interesting what you said about the Mandalas and I am so hyped you bought one! I had a course at university about tibetian Buddhism last year and the teacher also talked a lot about the Mandalas and what important part they play in their rituals. I have never heard about a religion in which artworks play such a special role in the traditions and rituals and I thought it was seriously epic. 
I am also really impressed how quickly you managed to connect with one of the locals, I bet getting shown around by Mukesh was very exciting and you got to see so many more special things than you would have otherwise!
Also daaaaamn, Momos are sooo epic, I am really glad you got to try them.. damn, now I am hungry!
Looking forward to reading more soon! Sending looohoove your way,

Greetings from far, far away,
