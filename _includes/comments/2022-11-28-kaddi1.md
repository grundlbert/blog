jo, jungle princess, I am a bit late to the party but finally found some peace and quiet to reply to your wonderful blog! What you said about going to and arriving in Kathmandu really takes me back to traveling, how exciting, how nerve wrecking, how adventurous! I am glad I get to be part of your journey like this! I am hoping you and Maddin are doing great, sending loads of love and hugs!

Greetings from far, far away,
